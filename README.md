# Project Logs Analysis

In this project, we worked on our SQL database skills. We interacted with a live database both from the command line and from your code. And built and refined complex queries and used them to draw business conclusions from data.

There were three questions and the results were printed to the screen.

* What are the most popular three articles of all time?
* Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
* On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Running The Database Query

**This is under the assumption that you are using the Udacity provided database and virtual machine.**

Once your VM has started navigate to `cd /vagrant` and place the file `db_project.py` in the directory.

Then you will need to load the database, please use the command `psql -d news -f newsdata.sql` from the command line.

Run the file `python db_project.py` from the command line.

The output of the query should look like the output of the text file `output.txt`.
